# Stream-based Active Learning for Image classification

## Machine Learning model

SVM

## Selection Strategy
* Query form committee based on result of 8 binary classifiers

## Prediction Strategy
1. Choose first positive prediction as final prediction

## Future Plan
1. Change machine learning model, e.g. decision tree, logistic regression
2. Random select a prediction among positive predictions
3. Choose best prediction based on score, kind of probability based selection
4. Use one classifier to make predictions
