# Pool-based Active Learning for Image classification

## Machine Learning model

SVM

## Ranking Strategy
* Entropy based ranking
    * Choose the observation with largest entropy
    * Use the Best v.s. Second-Best Selection
* Choose observations based on expected loss optimization
    * Batch mode selection
    * Expected Loss Optimization + entropy based


## Future Plan
1. Change machine learning model, e.g. decision tree, logistic regression
